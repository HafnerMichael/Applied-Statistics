    "Overall, the company does not fill the bottles insufficiently on a large scale. Firstly, with a CI of 95% the bottles are filled to at least 998.9ml. Secondly, the standard deviation of 3ml allows quite large errors. Furthermore, the company fills bottles with a /nominal/ value of 1000ml. Since the filling machine and also the measuring equipment will introduce some error as well, this problem becomes even harder to judge. Therefore, it depends on the regulations whether this deviation is acceptable. Since the company surely wants to make money and therefore fill the bottles with as little quantity as possible one can understand this decision)))."
